**Isoventure - Barely Working title**

[Isoventure](http://i.imgur.com/0r3DF.png) is a canvas/javascript 2D isometic nethack/rogue like game.

This week I have been working on my rendering system, between bursts of loathing of javascript. Occasionally giving up on Javascript entirely before coming to my senses.

I have added a debug view for the tile map, and an in game tilemap editor that lives inside a different canvas. Tiles can be changed by clicking in the tile grid view(the thing on the left). 

I have also changed rendering so that entities are drawn at the same time as their parent tile, allowing better Z ordering. This is an O(T^E) operation though, so it needs worked on. I have also added transparency filters for tiles that block the view of the player.

For the coming week I have a sort list of things to start working on.

 - A better name
 - Path finding (A* variation probably)
 - Walk to square on a click
 - Fix animation so it matches to movement
 - Reloadable state (either browser or to a server)
 - Particles
 - Rooms
 - Actual WORKING version control (coda didnt like my local git)

A part from the gamedev enforces bipolarness I am enjoying working on this idea. Hopefully next week I will be a level where games play can start to appear.
